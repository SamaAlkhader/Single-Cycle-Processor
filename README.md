# Single-Cycle-Processor
##Description
This project involves designing a RISC based 16 bit single cycle processor using Logisim simulator. The processor features:
-Separate instruction and data memory for improved performance (Harvard Architecture).
-Supports 16-bit instructions that include R-type, I-type, SB-type and J-type.
-Provides simulation and testing using Logisim that proves how the processor mimics real processors.

##Objectives:
-Build a solid understanding of the Logisim software.
-Work collaboratively in a team setting.
